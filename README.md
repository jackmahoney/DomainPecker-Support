## About
[DomainPecker](https://www.domainpecker.com) is a free webapp for generating domain names. It takes a keyword and combines it with a random word from a list of punchy, generic terms and searching for available domains. It's a simple, free project aimed at helping early Startups and Saas apps pick a name. This is not a commerical product so if you enjoy it please let the developers know — it means a lot.

## Why?
[DomainPecker](https://www.domainpecker.com) was creating at a time when the developers had a lot of Saas apps in the works but very few suitable names. Picking a name is hard, so why not just generate a reasonable one with a `.com` domain and run with it?

## How
Go to [DomainPecker](https://www.domainpecker.com) in a browser. Enter a keyword that is relevant to your company/application/website. Pick from a list of term-type, for instance, animals. Pick a position for the term, either suffix or prefix. Lastly, select a domain ending, such as `.io` or `.com`, and click `Generate`.

The webapp then calls an API which picks random terms from the term lists and combines them with your keyword and domain ending. It then calls Namecheap to find out is the domain is available. Once it has finished the results page is shown. From here you can buy a domain or continue searching.

## Feedback
This project is in active development. Your ideas and feature requests are highly valued. Got an idea for a list? Let us know! What to add more domains — gladly :).

## F.A.Q.
**What does DomainPecker mean?**
Well, funnily enough, we used our own site to pick a domain. We combined animals with the keyword `Domain` and `domainwoodpecker.com` was available. We bought the shorter form.

Have fun.
